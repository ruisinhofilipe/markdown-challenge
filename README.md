#### You can always count on me when ... 

As a group and if the group wants to succed, everyone needs to work and do their part of the job and that's exactly what you can expect from me. 
I also like to help the others, whenever it's possible / I know about your question/topic and I'm able to help. My french is really average, not bad but also far from being good, so I'm sure you'll have greats laughs hearing me trying to speak french which is always a plus.


##### Funny Story

So, have you heard about the mobile game called PokemonGO, right ? 
In case you didn't it's because your probably lived in a cave for the past decade or so .. 

Basically you use your phone to play Pokemon in real life, the game kinda simulates the anime and you can capture pokemons, fight against others people and so one.

A few years ago I was playing it with some friends outside and we were really excited because a legendary Pokemon had come out that day and we wanted to capture it.
In order for us to capture it we have to group up with other people and fight that new legendary pokemon in a RAID, this RAIDS are spawned in a certains locations around you and in order to fiht the pokemon you have to walk/drive until there.
So, there we were, trying to find more people to do the raids with us.
For Context, let's call the Legendary pokemon by WER.

After a few minutes of searching, we saw a couple close to one of the locations, they were probably between 30-40yo, which was normal at the time because everyone from all type of age was playing the game. 
We aproached the couple and we asked "Hey! are you here for WER(the legendary pokemon)?

Turns out they were undercover cops and by WER they assumed we were trying to sell them / buy from them drugs .. we tried to explain that everything was a missunderstanding and in reallity we were just "capturing pokemons".
They ended by searching for something in ours backpacks but eventually they let us go.

###### TL;DR
Asked a couple of undercover cops if they were also trying to capture a legendary Pokemon in PokemonGo and they tought I was trying to sell / buy drugs.
